# Text-recognition-from-the-images.
In this project, hand written digit in the images is recognized using logistic regression analysis,
# Following libraries and tools are used in this project:
1. Importing the required libraries
2. Loading the digits dataset from sklearn.datasets
3. Spliting the dataset into train and test segments for training and testing the model
4. Predicting the accuracy of the model using score method
5. Visualizing the model's predicted and testing values in the form of confusion matrix.
6. Check the model for its failure using Confusion matrix

Confuison Matrix
